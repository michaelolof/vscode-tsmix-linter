# TypeScript Mix Linter

This extension is a linter for vscode to extends typescript's and typescript-mix functionality.

## Features
A simple linter for the typescript-mix module which provides linting for the @use and @delegate decorators.

## Requirements
Looks for any module using the typescript-mix library and tries to provide linting support for the decorators.

Ensure the decorators are not renamed as this library specifically looks out for the "@use" and "@delegate" decorators.
